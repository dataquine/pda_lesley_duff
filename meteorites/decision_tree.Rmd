# Decision Tree
```{r}
libary(tidyverse)
```

This is a mini homework for people doing the PDA. You are going to continue 
working on your week 2 weekend homework.

Based on the mass and year, create a decision tree model of your meteorites 
data which predicts whether a meteorite was seen falling, or was discovered 
after its impact (fell/found).

First, you want to convert any character column to a factor. Next (and most 
importantly) split your dataset into training and testing datasets. Then 
create a decision tree with rpart and plot it using rpart.plot. Finally, test 
and add your predictions to your data, and create a confusion matrix.

```{r}
# Load clean meteorite data
meteorite_landings <- read_csv("clean_data/meteorite_landings.csv")
```
