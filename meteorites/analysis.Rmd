# Meteorites Analysis

We have data from [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) which has information on 
meteorites that have been found up to the year 2013.

```{r}
source("cleaning.R")

# Read the cleaned data into R.
meteorite_data <- process_meteorite_landings_file("data/meteorite_landings.csv")
```
## Names and years for the 10 largest meteorites

```{r}
# Find the names and years found for the 10 largest meteorites in the data.
meteorite_data %>% 
  slice_max(mass_g, n = 10) %>% 
  select(name, year)
```
## Average mass of meteorites

```{r}
# Find the average mass of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those 
# which were just found.
meteorite_data %>% 
  group_by(fall) %>% 
  summarise(avg_mass_g = mean(mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000.

```{r}
# Find the number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000.
meteorite_data %>% 
  filter(year >= 2000) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_meteorites = n())
```
