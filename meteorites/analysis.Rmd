# Meteorites Analysis

We have data from [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) which has information on 
meteorites that have been found up to the year 2013.

```{r}
source("cleaning.R")

# Read the cleaned data into R.
meteorite_data <- process_meteorite_landings_file("data/meteorite_landings.csv")
```
## Names and years for the 10 largest meteorites

```{r}
meteorite_data %>% 
  slice_max(mass_g, n = 10) %>% 
  select(name, year)
```
