# Penguins analysis part 1
We are interested in how bill length differ between the three species of penguin
(Adelie, Chinstrap & Gentoo) in this dataset.

## 1. Exploratory analysis

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins 
```


```{r}
# Which species of penguin are we interested in?
penguin_species <-  c("Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo") 

```

```{r}
# Initial examination of dataset
dim(penguins)

glimpse(penguins)

skimr::skim(penguins)

penguins %>% 
count(species)

# Take a closer look at the NA rows
penguins %>% 
  filter(is.na(bill_length_mm))
# Just two rows

```


## 2. Summary statistics

## 3. Hypothesis test & probability
