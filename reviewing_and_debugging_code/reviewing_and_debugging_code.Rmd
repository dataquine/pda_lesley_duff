# Reviewing & debugging code
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
energy_scotland <- read_csv("data/energy_scotland.csv")
energy_scotland

all_salaries <- read_csv("data/all_salaries.csv")
all_salaries
```
## Task 1

Old code:

```{r}
max(energy_scotland$energy_prod)
# this returns value 25165.9 

energy_scotland %>%
  filter(energy_prod == 25165.9)
```

New code
```{r}
energy_scotland %>% 
  slice_max(energy_prod, n = 1)
```
In the old code the value obtained from max was manually hard-coded to one value.
The filter line did not automatically use this maximimum value. Both lines 
replaced by one more efficient line using slice_max which will always 
recalculate the maximum value for energy_prod.
