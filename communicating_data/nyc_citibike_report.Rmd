# 1. Documentation

## Domain knowledge (1.1)

[*Citi Bike*](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/about) is the largest [bike share system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle-sharing_system) in the United 
States of America and consists of a fleet of bikes available for hire to users 
at docking stations throughout New York City. Hired bikes can be returned to 
any station. Citi Bike is available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 
365 days/year.

The data provided to us is a small sample of NYC Citi Bike usage of 10 bikes 
throughout 2018.

Data Source:
* [NYC Citi Bike trips](https://rdrr.io/github/tidyverts/tsibbledata/man/nyc_bikes.html)


For example: *NYC Citi Bikes is a company that...* or *The bike hire industry is...*
  
## Business requirements (1.2)

Citi Bike would like to know more about the following:

* What is the pattern of bike hires over time (e.g. within a year, month, week, 
or day)?
* Do bike hire patterns differ between bike rider demographics? (e.g. gender, 
type of trip, age)
* Any other insights?

The data will be examined to understand how a Citi Bike hire is recorded. 
We will then break down trips against different periods of time to try and 
identify whether there are broad patterns at different times of year or very 
specific ones throughout the day.

For demographics we will look at information relating to the person making the 
hire and whether any particular categories dominate more than others.

#### Business processes and data flow (1.3)

Create a diagram that shows how the Citi Bike dataset is created (which variables are added when) and demonstrates an understanding of the business process and flow of the data.

For example:

#### Data visualisation as a tool for decision-making (1.4)

Briefly describe how this report can help NYC Citi Bikes make better data-driven business decisions.

By looking at a sample across a full calendar year it may give understanding of 
customer behaviour affecting hires to be aware of and to resource availability 
accordingly. Time based data could be incorporated into the scheduling of any 
promotional campaigns. Demographics insights could identify potential groups to 
be targeted by marketing activity or drive further separate research into which 
groups drive more hires versus reasons why other don't/can't use it.

#### Data types (1.5)

List the different types of variables contained in the dataset and explain each of them to a non-technical audience. (e.g. integer, character, datetime)

#### Data quality and data bias (1.6)

Do you have any concerns about bias or quality in the dataset? Why/why not?

# 2. Data cleaning

#### Preparing data for visualisation (1.7)

Please include your cleaning/wrangling steps under this section.

# 3. Data visualisation

#### Process and design (2.1, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9)

Briefly describe your data visualisation process.

For example: *First, I investigated variables of interest with simple single-variable distribution plots. Then I plotted variables of interest to the business against each other to see if any patterns were present in the data. After selecting key visualisations I ensured these were clearly portraying the message I wanted to convey, were aesthetically pleasing, as well as accurate and not misleading. All visualisations were made in RStudio using the `ggplot` package.*

#### Visualisations (2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6)

For each plot you include in your report, please:

**Describe the visualisation: what kind of visualisation is it and what information does it contain?**

For example: _This scatter plot shows the relationship between age (years) and spending (GBP), where the red line represents a line of best fit, and the shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval._

**Why is this visualisation important to the business? What does it mean/how can it be used?**

For example: _The highlighted relationship between age and spending can be used by the business to create better targeted advertisements for different age groups as well as make better predictions of customer behaviour._
